This game is my first unity project. I just wanted to learn how unity works and how I can build a world with it's help. After starting the game you get 3 lives,
and every time you touch a monster or fall into the spikes you lose a life. After losing all three lives you need to start over. You have the option to save current level
so you don't have to start from the first one all over again.

The most challanging part was the Save part.

It was a fun journey and I learned a lot from working on this game.

You can find the C# code inside ./Assets/Scripts
